# 🛹 SkateSpot Guesser

**SkateSpot Guesser** is a GeoGuessr-style web game that challenges players to identify famous real-world skateboarding spots by pinpointing them on a map. Built using the OpenStreetMaps/React-leaflet with Nextjs, this app blends geospatial technology and skate culture to create a unique, engaging user experience.

## 🚀 Features

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Nextjs** – frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – styling
- (Optional future) **Supabase or Firebase** – for storing high scores and user accounts

## 🎯 Purpose & Learning Goals

I built this project to:

- Solidify my understanding of **TypeScript** and **React functional components**
- Learn how to **work with third-party APIs and SDKs** in a modern frontend workflow
